    <h1>David Copperfield by Charles Dickens</h1>
    <h2>
      The original (or at least most well-known) semi-autobiographical novel follows the titular character from his birth to the end of his life. Many, if not most of the main elements of Copperfield’s life mirror Dickens’ own, from his childhood labors to his adult career choices to some of his romantic escapades. David Copperfield is one of my favorite Dickens novels and contains my absolute favorite Dickens character, the crotchety-yet-good-hearted aunt, Betsy Trotwood.
