    <h1> You wouldn’t explode in space without a spacesuit</h1>
    <p id="p1">It is a common myth that your body would explode in space if you don’t wear a spacesuit. Human skin is strong enough to keep the body from bursting. In fact, you can live up to two minutes in the space unprotected. But, eventually, of course, you’d die.

        Also, you won’t freeze immediately in space, as in the Hollywood movies, despite its average temperature being so low (3 K, or -270 °C, -454 °F). Because there’s no matter in the space, so the heat does not leave the body quickly enough. You only lose heat via thermal radiation, of course, you will get colder and eventually freeze but very, very slowly.</p>
    <p id="p2">There’s also a thing called Armstrong limit, often called Armstrong’s line. It is the altitude that produces an atmospheric pressure so low that water boils at the normal temperature of the human body: 37 °C (98.6 °F). The Armstrong line begins at an altitude of approximately 18 km (60,000 ft) to about 19 km (62,000 ft). It would be better to wear a spacesuit above that altitude, for your own safety (your blood’s not going to boil though, as the walls of the veins keep your blood pressure high enough to stop your blood from boiling).

        At or above the Armstrong limit, exposed bodily liquids such as saliva, tears, urine, blood, and the liquids wetting the alveoli within the lungs -but not vascular blood (blood within the circulatory system), as explained before-will boil away without pressure suit, and no amount of breathable oxygen delivered by any means will sustain life for more than a few minutes.</p>
