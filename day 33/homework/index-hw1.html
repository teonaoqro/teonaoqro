        1. Earth is a fast-moving spacecraft
        <br>
        We’re living in a big, fast-moving (really fast!) spacecraft. Even when you’re resting on your armchair, you’re flying through space faster than the fastest human-made object ever built: around 1.3 million miles per hour (2.1 million km/hr).

            Long before the Soviet-made Sputnik truly began the space age in 1957, on October 24, 1946, the first photo of Earth from space has been taken. The scientists launched a Nazi-built V-2 rocket (No. 13) from the White Sands Missile Range, a United States Army rocket range in southern New Mexico. There was a camera aboard the rocket, and when the rocket reached 105 km (65 mi), the black-and-white photo was taken. The rocket was one of the V-2 rockets captured and moved to the US at the end of WWII.</p>
            <p id="p3">4. Earth is the densest planet in our Solar System
                If you’re looking for the densest planet in our solar system, you don’t have to look far: Earth is the densest planet in our Solar System. It has a density of 5.51 grams per cubic centimeter. This is only the average density of the planet. The core is much denser than the oceans for example.</p>
