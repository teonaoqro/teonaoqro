    <p id="p1">Speaking of surviving in the vacuum, Tardigrades, also known as water bears, can live 10 days in the vacuum, which makes them the hardest animal in existence. Two species of dried-up tardigrades were sent to space in 2007, and ten days later, they’ve been brought back, alive. They can also survive extreme conditions that would be rapidly fatal to nearly all other known life forms.<p>
    <p id="p2">They can withstand temperature ranges from 1 K (-458 °F; -272 °C) (close to absolute zero) to about 420 K (300 °F; 150 °C), pressures about six times greater than those found in the deepest ocean trenches, ionizing radiation at doses hundreds of times higher than the lethal dose for a human, and the vacuum of outer space. They can go without food or water for more than 30 years, drying out to the point where they are 3% or less water, only to rehydrate, forage, and reproduce.</p>
